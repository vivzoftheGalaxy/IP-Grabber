# WHY?

Reasons are given in README.md
Also, an additional reason is that, instead of coding it yourself, go to an untrustworthy website, or can't find a website that won't POTENTIALLY take your data.
This can be used from the comfort of your own home, with no trackers, and no nothing bad like that.

Plus, amazing user interface (UI) that took a while.
